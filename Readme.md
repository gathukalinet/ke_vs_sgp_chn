## Strategic Innovation Gap Analysis for Kenya 
This paper delves into Strategic Development in Kenya Through Innovation and Technology. It seeks to analyze the development of two developed countries over 17 years (China and Singapore), juxtaposing their most important growth indicators against Kenyaâ€™s . The findings indicate a substantial difference in development strategies and focuses between the three countries. A list of recommended approaches aim to propose changes to the Kenyan economy with a specific emphasis on the technological and innovation strategies.

#### Methodology
The research employed a comparative analysis of two developed countries: China and Singapore against Kenya. The data was drawn from the World Bank database over 50 years from 1975. To make concessions for available data in the key indicators such as energy consumption and high-tech imports, the dataset was reduced to 17 years for China and Singapore(2007-2023) and 13 years for Kenya (2008-2023, with missing years in 2011, 2012 and 2014). The method was a comparative feature analysis; using models like LinearRegression, Random Forest and XGBoost to compare the relative influence of indicators in predicting GDP across the 3 countries.
